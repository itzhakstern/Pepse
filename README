URL explanation:


Infinite world explanation:
To create the infinite world we first overwrite the function update and then when
the function update was called we checked if the position of the avatar player was changed.
In case that it was a change in the position of avatar we removed the unnecessary objects
from the game and therefor we did not use unnecessary cpu circles.
In case that was not a change in the avatar position we act as GameManager act.
(we did not add anything)

Tree class explanation:
we have here x class:
    BuildTree class: this class create the trees in the game (call Tree.create x times)
    Tree class: this class first create the races in the spastic range and then create the leafs
    around each race by calling the constructor of the leaf class.
    Leaf class: this class represent the leafs in the game.
    LeafStatus: this class represent the stats of the leafs {ON_TREE, FALLING, ON_GROUND}
